# Introduction to Statistics
> *"Statistics is the grammar of science."* - Karl Pearson

## 📊 What is Statistics?
**Statistics** is the science of collecting, organizing, and analyzing data to make informed decisions and draw meaningful conclusions from information.

## 🔍 Types of Statistics
Statistics is divided into two main branches:

### 1️⃣ Descriptive Statistics
**Definition:** It consists of organizing and summarizing data

**Components:**
- **📊 Measures of Central Tendency:** Mean, Median, Mode
- **📈 Measures of Dispersion:** Variance, Standard Deviation
- **📋 Different types of Distribution of data**
  - Examples: Histogram, PDF, PMF

**Example:** Let's say there are 20 statistics classes at your college, and you have collected the heights of students in the class.

Heights recorded: `[175cm, 180cm, 140cm, 140cm, 135cm, 160cm, 185cm, 190cm]`

**Descriptive Question:** *"What is the average height of the entire classroom?"*
```
Calculation: (175+180+140+140+135+160+185+190) / 8 = Average Height
```

### 2️⃣ Inferential Statistics  
**Definition:** It consists of using data you have measured to form conclusions

**Components:**
- **🧪 Hypothesis Testing**
  - Z-test, t-test
  - H₀, H₁, p-value, significance value
- **📊 Chi Square tests**

**Inferential Question:** *"Are the heights of the students in classroom similar to what you expect in the entire college?"*

This involves using your **sample data** (classroom) to make inferences about the **population data** (entire college).

    style C fill:#fce4ec,color:#000

```

## 🎯 Population vs Sample
Understanding the relationship between population and sample is fundamental to statistics:

### 🌍 Population
**Definition:** The group you are interested in studying
- Represents the **entire** group of interest
- Usually large and difficult to study completely
- Example: All students in the college

### 📋 Sample  
**Definition:** A subset of population
- A **smaller, manageable** portion of the population
- Used to make inferences about the population
- Example: Students in one statistics classroom

    style B fill:#fff3e0,color:#000

```

    style D fill:#e8f5e8,color:#000
    style B fill:#fce4ec,color:#000
```

**Key Point:** We use sample statistics to estimate population parameters!

## 📈 Key Concepts

### Data
**Definition:** Facts or pieces of information that can be collected, measured, and analyzed.

**Example:** Heights of students in a classroom
```
{135 cm, 180 cm, 190 cm, 160 cm, 145 cm, 175 cm, 168 cm, 172 cm}
```

## 📏 Scales of Measurement
Understanding the scale of measurement is crucial for choosing appropriate statistical methods. There are four main scales:

### 1️⃣ Nominal Scale Data
- **Definition:** Qualitative/Categorical data
- **Characteristics:**
  - Order does not matter
  - Categories with no ranking
  - Can only count frequencies and find mode
- **Examples:**
  - Favorite Color: Red (5) → 50%, Blue (3) → 30%, Orange (2) → 20%
  - Gender: M, F
  - Blood Type: A, B, AB, O

### 2️⃣ Ordinal Scale Data  
- **Definition:** Categorical data with meaningful order
- **Characteristics:**
  - Ranking is important
  - Order matters
  - Differences cannot be measured precisely
- **Examples:**
  - Rating Scale: 1 → Best, 2 → Good, 3 → Bad
  - Education Level: High School < Bachelor's < Master's < PhD
  - Customer Satisfaction: Poor < Fair < Good < Excellent

### 3️⃣ Interval Scale Data
- **Definition:** Numerical data with equal intervals
- **Characteristics:**
  - Order matters
  - Differences can be measured
  - **No true "0" starting point**
  - Ratios cannot be calculated meaningfully
- **Examples:**
  - Temperature: -30°F, -15°F, 30°F, 60°F, 90°F, 120°F
    - Difference: 60°F - 30°F = 30°F (meaningful)
    - Ratio: 90°F ÷ 30°F = 3:1 (NOT meaningful - 90°F is not "3 times hotter")

### 4️⃣ Ratio Scale Data
- **Definition:** Numerical data with true zero point
- **Characteristics:**
  - Order matters ✓
  - Differences are measurable ✓
  - **Contains a true "0" starting point** ✓
  - Ratios can be calculated meaningfully ✓
- **Examples:**
  - Student marks in a class: 0, 90, 60, 30, 35, 40, 50
    - Mean = 30, 40, 50, 60, 35, 90
    - Differences: 40 - 30 = 10 points
    - Ratio: 90 ÷ 30 = 3:1 (90 is 3 times higher than 30)

## 📊 Scale Comparison Table

| **Scale** | **Order Matters** | **Measurable Differences** | **True Zero** | **Ratios Meaningful** | **Examples** |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------------------|---------------|---------------------|--------------|
| **Nominal** | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | Colors, Gender, Blood Type |
| **Ordinal** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | Ratings, Education Level |
| **Interval** | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | Temperature (°F, °C) |
| **Ratio** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Height, Weight, Age, Income |

  - Customer Feedback: Good, Bad, Better, Best
  - Education Level: High School, Bachelor's, Master's, PhD
  - Star Ratings: ⭐, ⭐⭐, ⭐⭐⭐, ⭐⭐⭐⭐, ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

### 📊 Data Types Summary Table

| **Data Type** | **Subtype** | **Description** | **Examples** | **Operations** | **Scale** |
|---------------|-------------|-----------------|--------------|----------------|-----------|
| **Quantitative** | Discrete | Countable whole numbers | Bank accounts, Children, Students | +, -, ×, ÷, Statistics | Ratio |
| **Quantitative** | Continuous | Any numerical value | Weight, Height, Temperature* | +, -, ×, ÷, Statistics | Interval/Ratio |
