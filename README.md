# Introduction to Statistics

> *"Statistics is the grammar of science."* - Karl Pearson

## 📊 What is Statistics?

**Statistics** is the science of collecting, organizing, and analyzing data to make informed decisions and draw meaningful conclusions from information.

## 🔍 Types of Statistics

Statistics is divided into two main branches:

### 1️⃣ Descriptive Statistics
**Definition:** It consists of organizing and summarizing data

**Components:**
- **📊 Measures of Central Tendency:** Mean, Median, Mode
- **📈 Measures of Dispersion:** Variance, Standard Deviation
- **📋 Different types of Distribution of data**
  - Examples: Histogram, PDF, PMF

**Example:** Let's say there are 20 statistics classes at your college, and you have collected the heights of students in the class.

Heights recorded: `[175cm, 180cm, 140cm, 140cm, 135cm, 160cm, 185cm, 190cm]`

**Descriptive Question:** *"What is the average height of the entire classroom?"*

```
Calculation: (175+180+140+140+135+160+185+190) ÷ 8 = Average Height
```

### 2️⃣ Inferential Statistics  
**Definition:** It consists of using data you have measured to form conclusions

**Components:**
- **🧪 Hypothesis Testing**
  - Z-test, t-test
  - H₀, H₁, p-value, significance value
- **📊 Chi Square tests**

**Inferential Question:** *"Are the heights of the students in classroom similar to what you expect in the entire college?"*

This involves using your **sample data** (classroom) to make inferences about the **population data** (entire college).

## 🎯 Population vs Sample

Understanding the relationship between population and sample is fundamental to statistics:

### 🌍 Population
**Definition:** The group you are interested in studying

- Represents the **entire** group of interest
- Usually large and difficult to study completely
- Example: All students in the college

### 📋 Sample  
**Definition:** A subset of population

- A **smaller, manageable** portion of the population
- Used to make inferences about the population
- Example: Students in one statistics classroom

```

**Key Point:** We use sample statistics to estimate population parameters!

## 📈 Key Concepts

### Data
**Definition:** Facts or pieces of information that can be collected, measured, and analyzed.

**Example:** Heights of students in a classroom
```
{135 cm, 180 cm, 190 cm, 160 cm, 145 cm, 175 cm, 168 cm, 172 cm}
```

## 📋 Types of Data

| Type | Description | Examples |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Qualitative** | Descriptive, non-numerical | Colors, Names, Categories |
| **Quantitative** | Numerical, measurable | Height, Weight, Age, Score |

### Quantitative Data Subtypes

- **Discrete**: Countable values (e.g., number of students: 25, 30, 35)
- **Continuous**: Measurable values (e.g., height: 165.5 cm, 170.2 cm)

## 📊 Data Visualization Examples

### Sample Dataset: Student Heights
```
Student A: 135 cm
Student B: 180 cm  
Student C: 190 cm
Student D: 160 cm
Student E: 145 cm
Student F: 175 cm
Student G: 168 cm
Student H: 172 cm
```

### Basic Statistics from Our Example:
- **Count**: 8 students
- **Range**: 135 cm - 190 cm (55 cm difference)
- **Average**: ~165.6 cm

## 🎯 Why Statistics Matters

Statistics helps us:
- ✅ Make data-driven decisions
- ✅ Identify patterns and trends  
- ✅ Predict future outcomes
- ✅ Test hypotheses
- ✅ Reduce uncertainty

## 📚 Common Statistical Applications

| Field | Application |
|-------|-------------|
| 🏥 **Healthcare** | Clinical trials, disease tracking |
| 💰 **Business** | Market research, sales forecasting |
| 🏫 **Education** | Student performance analysis |
| 🌡️ **Weather** | Climate modeling, predictions |
| 🏃 **Sports** | Player statistics, performance metrics |
