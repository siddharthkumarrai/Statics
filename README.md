# Introduction to Statistics
> *"Statistics is the grammar of science."* - Karl Pearson

## 📊 What is Statistics?
**Statistics** is the science of collecting, organizing, and analyzing data to make informed decisions and draw meaningful conclusions from information.

## 🔍 Types of Statistics
Statistics is divided into two main branches:

### 1️⃣ Descriptive Statistics
**Definition:** It consists of organizing and summarizing data

**Components:**
- **📊 Measures of Central Tendency:** Mean, Median, Mode
- **📈 Measures of Dispersion:** Variance, Standard Deviation
- **📋 Different types of Distribution of data**
  - Examples: Histogram, PDF, PMF

**Example:** Let's say there are 20 statistics classes at your college, and you have collected the heights of students in the class.

Heights recorded: `[175cm, 180cm, 140cm, 140cm, 135cm, 160cm, 185cm, 190cm]`

**Descriptive Question:** *"What is the average height of the entire classroom?"*
```
Calculation: (175+180+140+140+135+160+185+190) / 8 = Average Height
```

### 2️⃣ Inferential Statistics  
**Definition:** It consists of using data you have measured to form conclusions

**Components:**
- **🧪 Hypothesis Testing**
  - Z-test, t-test
  - H₀, H₁, p-value, significance value
- **📊 Chi Square tests**

**Inferential Question:** *"Are the heights of the students in classroom similar to what you expect in the entire college?"*

This involves using your **sample data** (classroom) to make inferences about the **population data** (entire college).

## 🎯 Population vs Sample
Understanding the relationship between population and sample is fundamental to statistics:

### 🌍 Population
**Definition:** The group you are interested in studying
- Represents the **entire** group of interest
- Usually large and difficult to study completely
- Example: All students in the college

### 📋 Sample  
**Definition:** A subset of population
- A **smaller, manageable** portion of the population
- Used to make inferences about the population
- Example: Students in one statistics classroom

```

### 🔄 The Statistical Inference Process

    style C fill:#fff3e0

```

**Key Point:** We use sample statistics to estimate population parameters!

## 📈 Key Concepts

### Data
**Definition:** Facts or pieces of information that can be collected, measured, and analyzed.

**Example:** Heights of students in a classroom
```
{135 cm, 180 cm, 190 cm, 160 cm, 145 cm, 175 cm, 168 cm, 172 cm}
```

## 📋 Types of Data
Data can be broadly categorized into two main types:

    B --> D[🎯 Discrete<br/>Whole Numbers]

    style E fill:#e8f5e8
    style F fill:#f3e5f5
    style G fill:#f3e5f5
```

### 🔢 Quantitative Data (Numerical)
**Definition:** Data that represents numbers and amounts, can perform mathematical operations (+, -, %, *)

#### 🎯 Discrete Data
- **Definition:** Whole numbers, countable values
- **Characteristics:** Cannot be broken down into smaller meaningful units
- **Examples:**
  - Number of bank accounts: 1, 2, 3, 5
  - Number of children in a family: 0, 1, 2, 4
  - Number of students in a class: 25, 30, 45

#### 📈 Continuous Data  
- **Definition:** Can take any numerical value within a range
- **Characteristics:** Can be measured with infinite precision
- **Examples:**
  - Weight: 65.5 kg, 72.3 kg, 80.125 kg
  - Height: 165.2 cm, 175.8 cm, 180.25 cm
  - Temperature: 25.7C, 32.4C, 18.9C
  - Speed: 60.5 km/h, 85.3 km/h

### 📝 Qualitative Data (Categorical)
**Definition:** Data that represents categories, qualities, or characteristics

#### 🏷️ Nominal Data
- **Definition:** Categories with no intrinsic order or ranking
- **Characteristics:** Just labels or names, no mathematical operations possible
- **Examples:**

  - Colors: Red, Blue, Green, Yellow

#### 📊 Ordinal Data
- **Definition:** Categories with a natural order or ranking
- **Characteristics:** Has meaningful sequence but intervals aren't necessarily equal
- **Examples:**
  - Customer Feedback: Good, Bad, Better, Best
  - Education Level: High School, Bachelor's, Master's, PhD
  - Star Ratings: ⭐, ⭐⭐, ⭐⭐⭐, ⭐⭐⭐⭐, ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
